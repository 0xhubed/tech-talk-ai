## Technical Setup

### Before Presentation

1. **Start Jupyter Lab:**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\projects\techTalkSide\presentation-site\maschine learning foundations content"
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. **Prepare all notebooks:**
   - Open all 6 notebooks in tabs
   - Run notebook 0 completely beforehand (AI discovery)
   - Keep notebooks 1-5 ready but not executed
   - Check all visualizations render

3. **Website readiness:**
   - Open `/neural` page
   - Test all "Launch Notebook" buttons
   - Verify interactive components work

4. **Display setup:**
   - **Screen 1**: Website (Chrome/Firefox)
   - **Screen 2**: Jupyter Lab with notebooks
   - Or use tab switching if single screen

### During Presentation

**Quick switches:**
- Alt+Tab (Windows) or Cmd+Tab (Mac) between browser and Jupyter
- Use bookmark bar for quick navigation to `/neural`

**If something breaks:**
- Pre-run cells beforehand and just show output
- Have static screenshots as backup
- Skip to next section if one component fails

## Key Talking Points

### Opening (Notebook 0)
> "AI isn't just about using models - it's about discovery. This agent just rediscovered the compound interest law that Einstein called the 8th wonder of the world, from scratch, with noisy data."

### Model Representation
> "All machine learning starts here: a simple equation with parameters we need to learn from data."

### Cost Function
> "How do we know if our parameters are good? We measure error. This bowl shape guarantees we can always find the best solution."

### Gradient Descent
> "This is how machines learn - take small steps in the direction that reduces error, iteratively."

### Neural Networks
> "Add non-linearity, stack layers, and suddenly we can learn anything - from recognizing faces to writing code."

### Transformers
> "This same foundation, scaled to billions of parameters with attention mechanisms, powers ChatGPT and Claude."

## Presentation Tips

### Pacing
- **Don't rush notebooks** - let visualizations sink in
- **Pause after key plots** - give audience time to absorb
- **Interactive moments** - ask "What do you notice?" before explaining

### Engagement
- **Relate to real-world:** "This is how Netflix recommends movies"
- **Show failures first:** Linear model failing builds suspense
- **Celebrate wins:** "Look how perfectly it learned the curve!"

### Technical
- **Clear variables:** Run `%reset -f` between notebook demos if needed
- **Font size:** Zoom browser and Jupyter to 125-150% for visibility
- **Dark mode:** Use dark Jupyter theme for presentations

### Recovery
- **If notebook crashes:** Have screenshots ready
- **If visualization fails:** Describe what should appear
- **If time runs short:** Skip experiments (cell 8), go straight to transformers
