---

## Page Structure

### Title Update
**Current:** "AI Agents & Discovery Loop"
**New:** "AI Agents"

**Tagline:** "From simple chains to autonomous reasoning: understand how AI agents plan, decide, and act."

---

## Section Breakdown

### 1. **Opening: What is an Agent?**
**Badge:** "Introduction"
**Pattern:** Similar to `DiscoveryDemoSection` from `/neural`

**Content:**
- **Definition callout:** Clear distinction between traditional programs, ML models, and agents
- **Key characteristics:**
  - Perceives environment through observations
  - Makes decisions autonomously
  - Takes actions to achieve goals
  - Learns from feedback (optional but common)

**Visualization:**
- **Interactive comparison diagram** showing:
  - Traditional program: Fixed logic (if/else flowchart)
  - ML model: Input → Prediction (single step)
  - Agent: Perception → Reasoning → Action → Observation loop

**Key Questions Callout Box:**
- When should you use an agent vs. a simple API call?
- What makes an agent "agentic"?
- How do agents differ from chatbots?

---

### 2. **Foundations: Understanding Chains**
**Badge:** "Step 1"
**Heading:** "LangChain: Sequential Processing Pipelines"

**Content:**
- **What is a Chain?**
  - Predefined sequence of operations
  - Deterministic flow (A → B → C)
  - Each step transforms input to output
  - No decision-making between steps

**Visualization Options:**
1. **Interactive Chain Builder**
   - Drag/drop components: Prompt Template → LLM → Output Parser
   - Show data flow with animated tokens
   - Click each node to see input/output transformation
   - Examples: Simple QA, Summarization, Translation

2. **Live Chain Execution Demo**
   - Input text box: User question
   - Visual pipeline showing each stage executing
   - Display intermediate outputs
   - Configurable chain types (SimpleSequentialChain, TransformChain, etc.)

**Code Example Display (with syntax highlighting):**
```python
# Simple Chain Example
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = "Translate {text} to {language}"
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template)
chain = prompt | llm | output_parser

result = chain.invoke({"text": "Hello", "language": "French"})
```

**Use Cases Panel:**
- Document summarization
- Text classification
- Question answering (non-retrieval)
- Format conversion

**Key Insight Box:**
"Chains are predictable and reliable but inflexible. Every execution follows the same path, regardless of input complexity."

---

### 3. **Evolution: From Chains to Agents**
**Badge:** "Step 2"
**Heading:** "When Chains Aren't Enough: The Need for Dynamic Reasoning"

**Content:**
- **Limitations of Chains:**
  - Cannot adapt to unexpected inputs
  - No ability to choose different tools
  - Fixed sequence even when suboptimal
  - Cannot self-correct or iterate

**Visualization:**
- **Side-by-side comparison interactive:**
  - **Left panel:** Chain trying to answer complex multi-step question
    - Shows rigid path failing
    - Highlights where it gets stuck
  - **Right panel:** Agent solving same question
    - Shows decision points
    - Highlights tool selection
    - Shows iterative refinement

**Example Scenario (Interactive):**
```
Query: "What's the weather in the hometown of the CEO of OpenAI?"

CHAIN approach:
1. Send to LLM → Gets stuck (needs tool calls)
2. Fails or hallucinates

AGENT approach:
1. Reasoning: "I need to find CEO of OpenAI"
2. Tool: Search("CEO of OpenAI") → "Sam Altman"
3. Reasoning: "I need Sam Altman's hometown"
4. Tool: Search("Sam Altman hometown") → "St. Louis, Missouri"
5. Reasoning: "Now I need weather for St. Louis"
6. Tool: WeatherAPI("St. Louis, MO") → "72°F, Sunny"
7. Final Answer: "It's 72°F and sunny in St. Louis, Missouri"
```

**Transition Callout:**
"Agents add a decision-making loop: observe → think → act → repeat until goal achieved."

---

### 4. **Core Concept: Agent Architecture**

  5. **Executor:** Runs the selected action

**Main Visualization: Interactive Agent Anatomy Diagram**
- **Central LLM node** (brain icon)
- **Connected tool nodes:** Search, Calculator, Database, Code Executor, Memory
- **Hover states:** Show example inputs/outputs for each tool
- **Animated execution flow:**

- **What is LangGraph?**
  - Graph-based framework for multi-step agent workflows
  - Explicit state management
  - Conditional edges (decision points)
  - Cycles and loops built-in
  - Human-in-the-loop support

**Main Visualization: Interactive Graph Builder**
- **Node types:** LLM call, Tool execution, Condition check, Human input
- **Edge types:** Always, Conditional, Looping
- **Live example:** Customer support agent graph
  - Start → Classify intent → Route to specialist → Execute tool → Validate → Loop or End

**Detailed LangGraph Example Visualization:**
```
┌─────────┐
│  START  │
└────┬────┘
     ↓
┌────────────────┐
│  Classify      │ ← LLM Node
│  User Intent   │
└────┬───────────┘
     ↓
   [Routing Decision] ← Conditional Edge
     ├→ Technical Issue → [Tech Tools] → [Solution Found?] ─No→ Human Escalation
     ├→ Billing → [Billing DB] → [Resolved?] ─Yes→ END
     └→ General → [Knowledge Base] → [Answered?] ─No→ Loop back
```

**Code Example (LangGraph):**
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# Define state
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[Message]
    next_step: str

# Create graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("classify", classify_intent)
workflow.add_node("search", search_tool)
workflow.add_node("answer", generate_answer)

# Add edges
workflow.add_edge("classify", "search")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "search",
    should_continue,  # function returning next node
    {
        "answer": "answer",
        "search": "search",  # loop back
        END: END
    }
)

# Compile
app = workflow.compile()
```

**Interactive Demo:**
- **User inputs query**
- **Graph highlights active node** in real-time
- **Shows state updates** at each step
- **Displays decision logic** at conditional edges
- **Visualizes loops and retries**

**LangGraph vs Simple Agent Comparison:**

#### **When to Use Agents:**
✅ **Good Use Cases:**
- Multi-step research requiring tool use
- Tasks needing dynamic adaptation
- Complex decision-making with uncertainty
- Iterative problem-solving
- Tasks requiring external data access

❌ **Bad Use Cases:**
- Simple, predictable workflows (use chains)
- Low-latency requirements (agents are slower)
- High-stakes decisions without human review
- Tasks where transparency is critical

#### **Key Challenges:**
**Visualization: Challenge Cards (Interactive)**

1. **Reliability**
   - Issue: Non-deterministic outputs
   - Solution: Validation layers, retry logic, human-in-loop
   - Example: Output schema validation

2. **Cost**
   - Issue: Multiple LLM calls per query
   - Solution: Caching, smaller models for routing, plan optimization
   - Metric display: Average cost per agent run

3. **Latency**
   - Issue: Sequential tool calls add up
   - Solution: Parallel tool execution, streaming, timeout limits
   - Benchmark: Chain (0.5s) vs Agent (3-10s)

4. **Debugging**
   - Issue: Complex execution paths
   - Solution: LangSmith tracing, step visualization, state logging
   - Interactive: Show LangSmith trace panel

5. **Safety**
   - Issue: Agents can take unexpected actions
   - Solution: Tool whitelisting, output validation, sandboxing
   - Example: Prevent file deletion, limit API scopes

#### **Best Practices Checklist:**
- [ ] Start with simplest approach (chain) and upgrade to agent only if needed
- [ ] Clearly define agent scope and boundaries
- [ ] Implement robust error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Use structured outputs for reliability
- [ ] Monitor and log all agent actions
- [ ] Set timeout limits to prevent infinite loops
- [ ] Validate tool outputs before using
- [ ] Implement cost tracking and limits
