# Machine Learning Foundations - Presentation Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Setup (5 minutes before presentation)

### 1. Start Jupyter Lab
```bash
cd "C:\projects\techTalkSide\presentation-site\maschine learning foundations content"
jupyter lab
```
- Should open at `http://localhost:8888`
- Keep terminal open in background

### 2. Prepare Discovery Notebook
In Jupyter, open and **run all cells** in:
- `0_discovery_compound_interest.ipynb`

This takes 2-3 minutes and must be done beforehand!

### 3. Open Website
```bash
cd C:\projects\techTalkSide\presentation-site
npm run dev
```
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/neural`

### 4. Dual Screen Setup
- **Screen 1:** Website (browser)
- **Screen 2:** Jupyter Lab (browser)

OR use Alt+Tab to switch between them

## üéØ Key Talking Points

### Opening:
> "Can AI discover mathematical laws from data? Let's watch..."

### Model Representation:
> "All ML starts with f(x) = wx + b - a simple equation we'll learn to optimize"

### Cost Function:
> "This bowl shape guarantees we can always find the best solution"

### Gradient Descent:
> "Watch the algorithm take small steps downhill to find minimum error"

### Neural Networks:
> "Add non-linearity, and suddenly we can learn ANY pattern"

### Transformers:
> "Scale this to billions of parameters with attention = ChatGPT"

## ‚ö° Quick Reference

### Notebook Launch Shortcuts
| Section | Notebook | Key Cells |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Discovery | 0 | All (pre-run) |
| Model Rep | 1 | 5-7, 16-21 |

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"Launch Notebook" button doesn't work:**
- Check Jupyter is running on localhost:8888
- Check path: `maschine learning foundations content/`
- Use "Download .ipynb" as fallback

**Notebook cell fails:**
- Skip to next cell
- Or skip to next section
- Have screenshots as backup

**Out of time:**
- Skip discovery demo
- Skip notebook 1, 2 (keep on website)
- Focus on neural networks (notebook 4)

**Too much time:**
- Show architecture experiments (cell 8, notebook 4)
- Deep dive into attention mechanism (notebook 5)
- Take more questions

---

**You're all set! The hybrid website + Jupyter flow will make complex concepts tangible and memorable. Good luck! üöÄ**
